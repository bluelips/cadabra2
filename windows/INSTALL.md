# Cadabra

A field-theory motivated approach to computer algebra. Started by Kasper Peeters <info@cadabra.science>. End-user documentation at http://cadabra.science/     Built from source code at https://github.com/bluelips/cadabra2 with source code documentation at http://kpeeters.github.io/cadabra2

### Installation steps
* Currently this is a bare-bones windows build. Several steps are required in order to get a functional application. It's also very fragile and requires precise dependencies. If you need more flexibility, build from source following the directions at https://github.com/bluelips/cadabra2
* Install python 2.7, 32 bit. 
  * The installation path might need to be C:\Python27, which is the default.
* Install MiKTeX
  * I installed version 2.9 to "C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9"
  * Run the updater, get all the packages. Due to the structure of MiKTeX, the updater needs to be run multiple times.
* Copy the Cadabra folder to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Cadabra"

### Running with the GUI
* Double click cadabra2-gtk.exe

### Running from a command line within the python interpreter
* From a command line, execute
  ``` python -i cmdstart.py ```
  
#### Thanks
